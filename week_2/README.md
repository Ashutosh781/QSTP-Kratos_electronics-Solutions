##PYTHON QUESTIONS##

#QUESTION 1# distance.py

--TRY TO RUN THE PROGRAM IN PYTHON 3.x

--PROVIDE ANY NUMBER OF COORDINATES IN (x,y,z) FORMAT IN A ROW WITH EACH INPUT SEPARATED BY A SPACE

--THE PROGRAM WILL GIVE BACK THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN THOSE COORDINATES

#QUESTION 2# grid.py

--RUN THE PROGRAM IN PYTHOON 3.x

--FIRST PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF INFECTED HOUSES AND THEN THEIR COORDINATES IN (x,y) FORMAT IN THE SAME MANNER ABOVE

--THE COORDINATES SHOULD IN RANGE (0,10) EXCLUDING 10

--THE PRINTED GRID REPRESENTS THE INFECTED HOMES WITH 1

--THE PROGRAM CALCULATES THE NUMBER OF SAFE HOMES, DEFINED BY HOMES REPRESENTED BY 0 AND HAVE NO 1 SURROUNDING THEM IN THE GRID
